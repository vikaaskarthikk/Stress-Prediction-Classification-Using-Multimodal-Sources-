###  | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Multimodal Physiology

This project predicts and classifies human stress levels using **multimodal physiological data** such as:

- 🔵 Electrodermal Activity (EDA)  
- ❤️ Heart Rate Variability (HRV)  
- 🔗 Fused EDA + HRV features  

A **hybrid LSTM + CNN deep learning model** achieves **97%+ accuracy** in detecting:

- ✔ No Stress  
- ✔ Interruption  
- ✔ Time Pressure

## 📌 Project Description

This BE major project implements a **multimodal stress detection system** using raw physiological signals collected from wearable sensors.  
Traditional stress prediction relies on subjective questionnaires, but this system uses **objective physiological markers**, preprocessed and learned through **deep neural networks**.

Core components include:

- ANN models for **EDA** and **HRV**  
- Multimodal **feature fusion**  
- Hybrid **LSTM + CNN** model  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, loss curves  
- System testing & evaluation  

The project uses real datasets from **SWELL** and **WESAD**, and achieves **~98% accuracy**, outperforming existing machine learning approaches.
